        I’m a second-year Bachelor of Computer Science student at Dalhousie University, passionate about building creative tech solutions. I work across the full stack-from sleek, responsive frontends to robust backends and I’m equally fascinated by AI/ML, where I experiment with models that make systems smarter and more adaptive. With a blend of problem-solving, design thinking, and curiosity, I’m always looking for new challenges that push me to grow as a developer and innovator.
